phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPubicSymphysisMorphologicalPhaseLabel	Categorical label abot a phase of degradation of pubic symphysis degradation in specimens of indeterminate sex				A distinct phase in the degradation of the pubic symphysis in specimens of indeterminate sex that is defined by morphological description.

phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPhase1	Phase I	Phase I for specimens of indeterminate sex			Symphyseal face has a billowing surface (ridges and furrows) which usually extends to include the pubic tubercle. The horizontal ridges are well-marked and ventral beveling may be commencing. Although ossific nodules may occur on the upper extremity, a key to the recognition of this phase is the lack of delimitation of either extremity (upper or lower). Also confer to the plaster cast corresponding to this phase as shown in Brooks & Suchey (1990, Fig.3).	Brooks, S., & Suchey, J. M. (1990).

phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPhase2	Phase II	Phase II for specimens of indeterminate sex			The symphyseal face may still show ridge development. The face has commencing delimitation of lower and/or upper extremities occurring with or without ossific nodules. The ventral rampart may be in beginning phases as an extension of the bony activity at either or both extremities.

phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPhase3	Phase III	Phase III for specimens of indeterminate sex			Symphyseal face shows lower extremity and ventral rampart in process ofcompletion. There can be a continuation of fusing ossific nodules forming the upper extremity and along the ventral border. Symphyseal face is smooth or can continue to show distinct ridges. Dorsal plateau is complete. Absence of lipping of symphyseal dorsal margin; no bony ligamentous outgrowths.

phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPhase4	Phase IV	Phase IV for specimens of indeterminate sex			Symphyseal face is generally fine grained although remnants of the old ridge and furrow system may still remain. Usually the oval outline is complete at this stage, but a hiatus can occur in upper ventral rim. Pubic tubercle is fully separated from the symphyseal face by definition of upper extremity. The symphyseal face may have a distinct rim. Ventrally, bony ligamentous outgrowths may occur on inferior portion of pubic bone adjacent to symphyseal face. If any lipping occurs it will be slight and located on the dorsal border. Also confer to the plaster cast corresponding to this phase as shown in Brooks & Suchey (1990, Fig.3).

phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPhase5	Phase V	Phase V for specimens of indeterminate sex			Symphyseal face is completely rimmed with some slight depression of the face itself, relative to the rim. Moderate lipping is usually found on the dorsal border with more prominent ligamentous outgrowths on the ventral border. There is little or no rim erosion. Breakdown may occur on superior ventral border. Also confer to the plaster cast corresponding to this phase as shown in Brooks & Suchey (1990, Fig.3).	Brooks, S., & Suchey, J. M. (1990).

phaleron-ae:IndeterminateSexPhase6	Phase VI	Phase VI for specimens of indeterminate sex			Symphyseal face may show ongoing depression as rim erodes. Ventral ligamentous attachments are marked. In many individuals the pubic tubercle appears as a separate bony knob. The face may be pitted or porous, giving an appearance of disfigurement with the ongoing process of erratic ossification. Crenulations may occur. The shape of the face is often irregular at this stage.	Brooks, S., & Suchey, J. M. (1990).
